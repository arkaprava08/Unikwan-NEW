                Interaction Designers ensure that the work we produce includes, from the very start of a project, 
                a fundamental understanding of the user. At Huge, our highly collaborative process starts with 
                development of the product's conceptual model—understanding exactly who the users are and describing 
                and ranking their goals and behaviors. We believe that without top-notch usability, the product can’t
                be a true success. Our talented Interaction Designers develop information architecture for a variety
                of digital products—our clients range from fashion houses to financial institutions and their needs 
                are just as varied. We need people who are comfortable with that kind of flexibility. People who can 
                confidently determine a product’s mandate, feature set, and business requirements, participate in user
                testing, create wireframes and functional prototypes, and more.
