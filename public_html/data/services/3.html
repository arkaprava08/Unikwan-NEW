Usability is the ease of use and learnability of a human-made object
</p>
<p>
It is very important to practice usability in order to get a feedback of design in User Experience. The feedback allows you to go back and refine part of the design to achieve ease of use. We practice and have experienced tremendous results in software products we designed. 
</p>
<p>
To give a you a basic of what we are talking about is:
</p>
<p>
Learnability: How easy is it for users to accomplish basic tasks the first time they encounter the design?
</p>
<p>
Efficiency: Once users have learned the design, how quickly can they perform tasks?
</p>
<p>
Memorability: When users return to the design after a period of not using it, how easily can they re establish proficiency?
</p>
<p>
Errors: How many errors do users make, how severe are these errors, and how easily can they recover from the errors?
</p>
<p>
Satisfaction: How pleasant is it to use the design?
</p>
