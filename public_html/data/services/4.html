    At Unikwan, motion graphics are integral to video production—as integral as color and focus.
</p>
<p>
    High-quality motion graphics add a level of production value that can take a video from the ordinary to the extraordinary, while also enhancing its underlying message and theme.
</p>
<p>
    Indigo’s motion graphics are not designed to impress people. They’re designed to engage our audiences more deeply in the central narrative.
</p>
<p>
    Our design team lets the story dictate the graphics, not the other way around.
</p>
<p>
    Using the most advanced hardware and software in the industry, Unikwans award-winning team of art directors, motion designers, video editors, animators, and motion graphic artists conceptualize and produce 2D and 3D graphic sequences as amazing as our writers and creative directors can dream.
